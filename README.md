# Automated Testing

This is a container for automated testing of a web project along with reporting, as informally presented in October 2018.

Automated tests are written in Selenium leveraging the page object model pattern. SpecFlow is used to demonstrate behavior driven development style acceptance tests linked to coded test steps leveraging the same page models as the individual automated integration tests.

The presentation slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13r4RROA3o9cOPFbd5_pNGUC9gUVRsBI1zndQzgwSOnE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Docs. They are also located within the unit test project in this solution.
